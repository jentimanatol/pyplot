## 📁 Directory Overview  
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my semester-long project on **Global Environmental Change**, part of the Spring 2025 curriculum at **Bunker Hill Community College**. This repository serves as a central hub for all research, code, data, and documentation developed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for **ENV-250: Global Environmental Change**, under the guidance of **Professor Krista Reichert**.

This project aims to raise awareness, provide data-driven insights, and explore practical, scalable solutions to combat environmental issues such as rising **CO₂ levels**, **poor air quality**, **deforestation**, and the impacts of **climate change**.

## 🌎 Why This Matters – Understanding the Global Crisis  

The Earth is undergoing rapid and often irreversible environmental changes due to human activity. From melting polar ice to increasing wildfires, droughts, and extreme weather patterns, the evidence is clear: we are in the midst of a climate emergency.

### Key Concerns:
- **CO₂ Concentration**: Carbon dioxide levels have surpassed 420 parts per million (ppm), the highest in recorded history, significantly contributing to global warming.
- **Air Quality**: Poor air quality from fossil fuel emissions and deforestation causes respiratory illness and premature deaths globally.
- **Deforestation & Land Use**: Forest loss reduces Earth's capacity to absorb CO₂, exacerbating climate effects and threatening biodiversity.

If current trends continue, we risk passing tipping points that may trigger irreversible climate feedback loops. Urgent, innovative, and community-focused action is necessary to reverse this trajectory.

## 📌 Purpose of the Project  

The goal of this project is to **develop data-informed, accessible tools** that demonstrate:
- How individual and collective actions impact the environment.
- How sustainable land use (e.g., **bamboo plantations**) can offset carbon emissions.
- The **economic feasibility** of implementing eco-projects on national and global scales.
- **Educational tools** to inspire environmental stewardship through interactive visualizations.

This repository includes multiple interactive Python and web-based applications to support these goals.

## 🧪 Project Title: Bamboo CO₂ Offset Calculator – Empowering Action Through Data  

### 🛠️ Overview  
This tool is designed to help users visualize how much **bamboo land area** is needed to offset a specific amount of CO₂ emissions. It also estimates:
- **Planting costs**
- **Number of bamboo plants required**
- **Percentage of a country’s GDP needed per year to offset emissions**
- **Interactive charts showing bamboo’s potential role in reforestation efforts**

By combining **scientific research**, **economic modeling**, and **interactive data visualizations**, this application aims to turn abstract climate data into tangible, action-based solutions.

## 💡 Project Impact  

Bamboo is a **fast-growing**, **carbon-sequestering**, and **renewable** resource. According to climate scientists, **one hectare of bamboo can absorb between 12–20 tons of CO₂ per year**, depending on species and climate.

**The Bamboo CO₂ Offset Calculator empowers users**—from students to policymakers—to:
- Understand their carbon footprint
- Explore the potential of bamboo as a reforestation strategy
- Calculate costs and land requirements to achieve national offset goals
- Compare different countries’ efforts and responsibilities

This tool has applications in **education**, **policy development**, **urban planning**, and **climate activism**.
