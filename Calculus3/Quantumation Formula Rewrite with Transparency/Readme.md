|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **γ**                           | Inspired by Dirac’s gamma matrices; here γ = *i√3* adjusted for Quantumation      |
| **τ_QCD**                       | Quantum Chromodynamics scale time (~10⁻¹⁸ seconds); sets temporal resolution     |
| **Ψ(x)**                        | Wave function, standard in quantum mechanics                                     |
| **Φ(x)**                        | Temporal flux operator, akin to terms in the Klein-Gordon equation               |
| **℘² / (τ_QCD)²**               | Correction term introducing feedback from ℘ itself (entirely new)               |
| **(τ_QCD)³ / 10x²**             | Nexus interval expansion to improve integral resolution near singularities       |

## 🧠 Conceptual Highlights

- **Quantum-grounded Parameters**: Every term is physically motivated, from relativistic waveforms to chromodynamic timescales.
- **Self-Coupled Correction**: ℘ depends on itself through the squared correction term, introducing recursive dynamics.
- **Flux-Phase Interaction**: Ψ(x) ⊗ Φ(x) represents the entangled interaction of spatial and temporal wave behaviors.
