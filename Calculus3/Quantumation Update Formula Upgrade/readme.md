## 🔬 Updated Quantumation Formula


- $℘ = \int_{\Omega \rightarrow \emptyset} \left[ \frac{Ψ(x) ⊗ Φ(x)}{\sqrt{-1 + (\mathbb{C} + 0.01i)x^Δ + \frac{℘^2}{Δ^2} + \frac{Δ^3}{10x^2}}} \right] dx$

## ⚙️ Notes for Implementation

- **Ψ(x)** and **Φ(x)** are system-specific functions that must be defined before integration.
- The domain `Ω → ∅` denotes collapse from a full spectral set to vacuum or minimal eigenstate.
- For integration, use **Gaussian quadrature** with **10,000 points** for optimal results.
- Make sure Δ ≠ 0 and x ≠ 0 to avoid singularities.
