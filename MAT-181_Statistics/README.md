# 📊 MAT 181 – Statistics-I Portfolio – Spring 2025  
### Bunker Hill Community College | Course: MAT-181-WB5 | Instructor: Professor Prem Paudyal Chhetry  

---
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my **Spring 2025 Statistics-I Portfolio**, completed as part of the curriculum for **MAT-181-WB5: Statistics-I** at **Bunker Hill Community College**, under the instruction of **Professor Prem Paudyal Chhetry**.  

This repository contains an extensive collection of **Python-based statistical visualizations**, **interactive plots**, and **programmatic explorations** of key statistical concepts. Rather than a single cohesive app, this portfolio demonstrates growth through **independent exercises**, each aligned with weekly topics from the course syllabus.

Every folder and file reflects an effort to apply statistics programmatically — leveraging tools such as `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `numpy` to turn formulas and theory into real-world visual insights.


This repository showcases my practical understanding of:
- **Descriptive statistics**: mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Probability theory**: uniform and normal distributions, conditional probability.
- **Data visualization**: histograms, stem-and-leaf plots, boxplots, frequency polygons.
- **Inferential statistics**: confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
- **Linear regression and correlation analysis**.
- Real-world applications of statistics using **simulation**, **sampling**, and **data storytelling**.

This course helped me build a foundational understanding of statistics through computation, logic, and visual insight. By working through each topic as a hands-on coding exercise, I developed practical skills that go beyond textbook learning — especially in data storytelling, pattern recognition, and simulation modeling.


Through this portfolio, I’ve learned how to:
- Use **Python to automate and visualize statistical analysis**.
- **Interpret statistical significance and data patterns** programmatically.
- Think like a statistician — questioning assumptions and validating results.
